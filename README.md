Contract Address: 
### Practice instrument made up of a EEG hooked up to sine wave generator that allows users to control the pitch of a sound using their neueral activity. Prepare musical artists for higher resolution neural interfaces that are able to pick up polyphonic and textured sounds.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to harness the capabilities of EEG headbands, which are widely recognized for their precision in monitoring brain activity, for an innovative application: real-time audio pitch modulation. The opportunity to adapt these devices for such a use is evident, given their advanced data capture and processing potential. By developing software that can interpret specific brainwave patterns indicative of the user's intent to modify sound pitch, we aim to create an interactive auditory experience that responds instantly to mental commands. This involves not just the technical integration of EEG data streams but also crafting algorithms capable of accurately translating these into audio pitch adjustments, all while ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Deliverables

### Electroencephalogram (EEG) Device Integration: ### 
A fully functional interface between the selected EEG headband (Muse or Emotiv) and the software application, ensuring real-time data capture and streaming capabilities.

### Signal Processing Module: 
A robust software module capable of filtering, analyzing, and interpreting EEG data in real-time. This module will detect specific brainwave patterns associated with the intent to change audio pitch and translate these signals into actionable commands.

### Audio Pitch Control System: 
A dynamic system that modulates the pitch of a sine wave oscillator based on the user's mental commands, as interpreted from their EEG data. This system will allow for continuous and smooth pitch adjustments within a predefined range.

### Calibration Tool: 
A user-friendly calibration tool that adapts the pitch control system to individual users' brainwave patterns, enhancing the accuracy and responsiveness of the pitch modulation based on mental activity.

### User Interface (UI): 
An intuitive and accessible UI that enables users to easily interact with the system, set preferences, and engage with the audio modulation process. The UI will also provide visual feedback on brain activity and pitch control status.

### Documentation and User Manual: 
Documentation detailing the system setup, operation, and troubleshooting, alongside a user manual that guides users through the calibration process, usage, and interpretation of feedback.

### Testing and Validation Reports: 
A detailed report of the testing and optimization processes, including user testing outcomes, system performance metrics, latency measurements, and any adjustments made to improve the system based on feedback.

### Software and Hardware Integration Guide: 
A guide that outlines the process for integrating the EEG device with the software application, including any necessary hardware setups, Bluetooth connectivity instructions, and software configuration steps.

### Open-source Repository (Optional): 
Access to an open-source repository containing the project's codebase, allowing for community contributions, future enhancements, and broader application of the developed system.

These deliverables will ensure that the project not only achieves its goal of allowing users to control audio pitch through brain activity but also provides a solid foundation for further research, development, and application of EEG-based control systems.

## Key Steps Involved
Integration with EEG Headbands: Utilize SDKs from Muse or Emotiv for real-time EEG data capture. Establish stable Bluetooth data streaming.
Signal Processing Module: Develop a module for real-time EEG data analysis to identify relevant brainwave frequencies and detect intent signals for pitch modulation.
Audio Pitch Control: Connect with an audio synthesis library to modulate a sine wave oscillator's pitch based on processed EEG signals, allowing continuous control within a set range.
User Interface and Calibration: Implement a calibration process for individual user brainwave pattern adaptation and an intuitive interface for system interaction.
Testing and Optimization: Perform comprehensive user testing to refine detection algorithms and minimize latency, optimizing for different environments and headband models.
Skills and Experience Required
Expertise in EEG data analysis and signal processing.
Experience with Bluetooth data streaming and hardware integration.
Background in audio signal processing and synthesis.
Knowledge of Muse and/or Emotiv SDKs.
Software development skills, ideally in Python, MATLAB, or similar environments.
UI/UX design capabilities for effective user interfaces.
Project Timeline and Effort Estimation
The project is expected to span 3-6 months, segmented into Planning and Design (1 month), Development and Integration (2-3 months), and Testing and Optimization (1-2 months).



## The Wider Context:
The goal of this Project is for you to be wearing our product and to do a one-man show but with the sound of a full band, all outputted in real time from your auditory imagination.

###High Level Roadmap:

Version 1 - portable EEG to sine wave. Looks and sounds like a theremin that is being played with no hands.
Use case scenario is someone outputting a melody from their brain directly into a DAW or PA environment. Can be used in combination with traditional effects.

Version 2 - Neuralink MIDI plugin
Uses a predictive tensorflow model trained on the entirety of Spotify library to transcode the user's auditory imagination into up to 16 distinct MIDI tracks. Can be used to control mecatronic acoustic, or digital instruments in real time. Practically work the entire band from your head.

Version 3 - Direct Audio Output
Once neural interfaces are capable of sufficient read resolution, we can extract the exact content of the auditory imagination. It's very likely that, in order to produce a coherent signal, the user would need a good amount of practice and inner discipline, which is why we're starting with a basic sine wave.
